                Dentists are trained professionals, we expect our dentist to be compassionate, understanding and skilled to fullfill 
                all our dental needs. It is important to know that even general practioners or family dentist tend to have areas of 
                focus or gear towards sections of the population.<br><br> 
                
                If your greatest barrier to getting dental work is fear and anxiety, you want to make sure your dentist has options, 
                for example oral sedation or nitrous gas. Also, word of mouth and friends recommendations can sometimes help find a 
                dentist with a gentle touch and anesthesia or needle technique.<br><br>
                
                Experienced dentist tend to be faster when delivering treatment as opposed to recent graduates. If you are planning 
                to bring your family you want to make sure there are dentist in the clinic who are comfortable seeing children and 
                perform treatment on young ones on a regular basis. Depending on your child's age and behaviour they might need to be
                seen by pediatric or child specialist dentist. Likewise if you have elder relatives you want to make sure mobility 
                accomodations can be made and denture services exist<br><br>

                Ff you require complex or extensive dental treatment, for example implants, you want to make sure your doctor has a
                 full skill set or offers in house specialty treaments, sometimes you might need to be referred to a specialist outside
                  your family dentist office.<br><br>

            Your Insurance
            </h4>
            <img src="images/dental_insurance.png" style="width:40%" alt="Dental Cartoon" class="images"/>
            <p class ="container">This is very important, you want to ask questions like if the office direct bills your insurance before you become a patient
               at a dental office. Direct billing is a convenient feature for patients, otherwise you have to pay upfront for service received 
               at each appointment and wait for your insurance to reimburse you.<br><br>

            It is strongly recommended that you review your benefits plan, once you become a patient at a dental office if you are not happy 
            with with your experience, it becomes complicated to shop around for more options. Your insurance policy has a limitation to the 
            frequency of certain services. For example a dental examination might be covered once every six months only. The first dental office 
            that you go to will be able to bill your insurance for initial records. This will not be the case if you go to a second or third 
            office in a short period of time, even if you still have unused coverage in your plan, for example $2000 per year per person. </p>

            <p class ="container">If you are someone with a busy schedule, the location of your dental office will be crucial to make it on time to your 
                appointments, as well as coordinating appointments for your family. Close to your home is often best, however often times 
                people will make a trip if they have found a dental practioner they like, workplace is another option for location convenience.</p><br><br>
